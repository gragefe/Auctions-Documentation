# Auction Platform Documentation

This repository serves as the **official documentation** for the auction platform, providing a detailed view of the design and architecture of services and APIs. The goal of this project is to supply the necessary documentation for developing and understanding the platform, including diagrams, a **Design System**, and a **Docker Compose** setup for easily configuring the local environment.

## üé® Design System

This project includes a **Design System** created to show the components and usability across the auction platform.

You can import the file "Auction Platform Design System.drawio" in the https://draw.io/ to check it.

## üîÑ Sequence Diagrams

To explain the internal workings of the platform's APIs and services, we have some  **sequence diagrams**. These diagrams provide a view of the flow flow each system follow, showing how requests flow between application layers, domain model, and services.
